I'm frequently interested in finding out out what IRC client people use when I notice that they disable CTCP version replies.  Frequently  I find that it is something such as mIRC.  At least in this case it is right for them to be ashamed of their IRC client, though if one is so ashamed of people knowing what IRC client they use shouldn't they just chose a different IRC client?

On the flip side, it's humerous to see the five line version replies from skript kliddies using mIRC whom are quite proud of not only their client but all of the attack, counter-attack, and counter-counter attack scripts.
