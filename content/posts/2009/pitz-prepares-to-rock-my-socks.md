<p><a href="http://blog.tplus1.com/">Matt Wilson</a> must be spying on my dialogs in sekrit IRC channels.  After setting up <a href="http://www.beckingham.net/task.html">Task</a> this evening I mentioned there being several project ticketing systems, like <a href="http://ditz.rubyforge.org/">Ditz</a>, that store data in the RCS.  I was lamenting the fact that there wasn't any of these systems written in anything other than ruby that I was aware of.</p>
<p>Reading my RSS feeds before bed, I found <a href='http://blog.tplus1.com/index.php/2009/02/22/my-new-ticket-tracking-system-is-now-vaporware/'>"My new ticket tracking system is now vaporware"</a> from <a href="http://blog.tplus1.com/">Matt Wilson's blog</a> talking about <a href="http://pitz.tplus1.com/">Pitz</a>, his soon to exist Python implementation of <a href="http://ditz.rubyforge.org/">Ditz</a>.</p>
<p>Please take a few moments to read over the feature set and example commands on the <a href="http://pitz.tplus1.com/">Pitz</a> site and let Matt know about any ideas/suggestions you may have.</p>
