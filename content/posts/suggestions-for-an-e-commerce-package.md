My wife has been working on putting a website together for the selling the jewelry she makes.  I have installed a copy of <a href="http://oscommerce.org/">OS Commerce</a> for her but it requires register globals be turned on in php as well as requring all product images to be the same size with one image per item.  I'm curious if others could suggest suitable alternative open source applications for operating an ecommerce website.  Feature requirements are minimal the primary requirement being non suckage.  Order notification via email would be nice and multiple images per item would be nice, requiring the use of register globals and requiring all product photos be the same size are no-nos.

I eagerly await the suggestions <a href="http://zork.net/~spork/you.jpg">you</a> have for me with baited breath, please hurry kind reader, or I may expire.
