Dynex is the Best Buy brand.  We were recently there and I noticed a $20 webcam that said it supported OS X 10.1 and greater on the box so I decided to purchase it.  I installed the included drivers and software and started up their software.  I just get a black screen with "No video input."  The LED on the webcam does turn on and off appropriately.  I took it back and exchanged it thinking the unit was deffective.  The new one had the same problem.
Unfortunately their included drivers are as ancient as the version of OS X referenced on the box.  There are a few commercial and open source driver sets available for web cam support on OS X but unfortunately this camera isn't supported by any of them.  They said they had 24x7x365 support on their website so I figured, what the heck, maybe they have some nice shiny new drivers they forgot to link to on the website.

This is the call:

<strong>"So what seems to be the problem?"</strong>
<em> "Well I have a Mac and the box said the Mac is supported so I installed the drivers and software that came with it and the software that came with it says there is no video from the cam"</em>
<strong> "Oh, well since you said you have a Mac you will need to contact the manufacturer of the computer
to see if..."</strong>
<em>"There is nothing wrong with the computer."</em>
<strong> "Right but maybe there is some sort of driver that you need for the Mac to make it work."</strong>
<em> "Exactly, and that driver comes from the manufacturer of the device, that would be Dynex, whom you
represent."</em>
<strong> Click.</strong>

Just to be clear, that  click there at the end is them hanging up on me.  I guess they couldn't argue with that.
