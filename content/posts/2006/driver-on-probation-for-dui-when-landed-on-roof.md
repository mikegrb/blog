The drunk driver that landed through a house roof after hitting a curb mentioned here previously was on probation for driving while intoxicated at the time of the accident. She hadn't been aressted at the time of the accident because the officers on the scene didn't check the conditions of her parole since killing a man by landing her car on his bed was concidered a nonviolent crime. She is currently being held without bail at the county jail.
