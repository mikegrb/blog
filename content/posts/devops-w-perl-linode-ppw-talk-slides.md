Earlier this month I gave a talk about <a href="http://www.linode.com">Linode's</a> use of <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">devopsy</a> things at the<a href="http://pghpw.org/ppw2011/"> Pittsburgh Perl Workshop</a>.  Finally getting around to posting the slides online.  I wanted to add some details so more of the slides made since on their own but haven't gotten around to it yet.
