Creating IPv6 rDNS zone files by hands sucks.  I've seen one tool to do it (plus dhcp configs and forward zones) and references to another that seems to be gone from the net.  The one I found is not well suited for my needs though.  Is there something awesome I just haven't found yet?

I guess I should stop being lazy and just write the tool.  Maybe even serve it up via the web for others in my situation.  Hmmm....
