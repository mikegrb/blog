I promise I'm not a comic book/super hero[tm] nerd, not that it's a bad thing.  I've never owned comic books but last night I was thinking about Superman vs. Spider-Man for some reason.

I think that Superman is the clear winner, he was super duper from the start.  Spider-Man on the other hand, he just happened to get bit by a messed up spider.  I didn't consider this a highly weighted factor though.  Superman is impervious to all but kryptonite, Spider-Man is way vulnerable.

Batman, though crazy cool with all the gadgets, isn't even in the running what with no super powers and all.
