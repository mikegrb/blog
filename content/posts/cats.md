So we have 2 cats and every other day or so give them a tin of wet cat food.  We give them one can to share and in the past we've gone to the trouble of splitting the can onto two saucers.  They both attack it at first but then lose interest and finish it off over the next few hours.  Due to this, recently we just leave it in the tin.  One of our cats is a bit over weight and she generally wins in the beginning when they both go after it.

I just gave them a tin and went to give the non-pigish cat a few treats to tide her over. As I bent down to put them off to the side of the can, she reached her paw out, grabbed the can and pulled it towards her and away from the other cat.  It was certainly el-hilarity and I just had to share.
