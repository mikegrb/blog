[Galloway Township](http://www.gtnj.org) considered a resolution last week that
would support fair trade practices. [The resolution was tabled](http://galloway.patch.com/articles/galloway-council-tables-fair-trade-resolution)
after some brief discussion.  The cost difference between fair trade and non fair
trade items was brought up and I was curious how much of a difference there was.

The town currently gets most office supplies from WB Mason.  I do not know if this
includes coffee but at work we get our coffee from WB Mason so as any Geek would
do, I made a spread sheet.

There are only two fair trade items in this category but they are right in line
with prices for non fair trade varieties.  If you are already using one of the
non fair trade blends from the two companies with a fair trade blend, there is 0
price difference.

This lack of price difference surprised me.
