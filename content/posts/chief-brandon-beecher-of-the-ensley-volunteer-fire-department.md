<p>Taken in the day room with two snooted strobes to the camera's left. Two strobes were used to prevent shadows from the helmet's brim. One is set to a height of about the middle of the helmet, the second is set just below the brim.<br />
<br />
I only have one snoot but two strobes were used for this shot. In true Strobist style, I ran to the kitchen and grabbed a bit of aluminum foil to fashion another makeshift snoot.<br />
<br />
A bit more light in the shadows on the left side of the face would have been nice, a piece of white poster board or even a piece of 8.5x11" paper could have lit the shadows a bit nicely.</p>
