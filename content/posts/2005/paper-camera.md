This is just nifty.  <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/gadgets/retro/index.php#dirkon-paper-camera-101452">Gizmodo </a> says it best.
<blockquote>
This DIY Dirkon Paper Camera is pretty cool. You see, in Eastern Europe under Communism they had to eat dogs and make their cameras out of paper. Therefore they got really good at folding Nikon-alike pinhole SLRs hence the Dirkon. Actually, I'm kidding about the dogs. Poland and the modern-day Czech Republic were more into rats and snakes.
