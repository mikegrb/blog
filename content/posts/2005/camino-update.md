Yesterday I went by the <a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a> website looking for something and found that version 0.8.3 was availible.  I lost some faith in Luca, I was sure that something as important as a Camino update would cause Luca to come running to me on IRC to make sure I knew, or maybe he doesn't know?  In that case, Luca: Camino 0.8.3 is availble!  It so rocks my socks.  Changelog follows.
