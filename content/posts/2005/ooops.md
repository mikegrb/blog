So I know I <em>just</em> posted but Octal just pointed this photo out to me and I couldn't resist posting this.

<strong>UPDATE:</strong> According to a <a href="http://www.herald-mail.com/?module=displaystory&story_id=111239&format=html">Herald-Mail Article about the accident</a>, it seems the freight train was stopped on the tracks for about 20 minutes when the Loram ran into it from the rear.
