Imagine, if you can, a town with a population below 300 and having to be there with no access to the Internets for  15 hours.  This is what I had to sufer through today do to some bright guy and his fiber slicing backhoe.  Also, the toe that got stung by a wasp yesterday itches like a bish today.  The itching is worse then the  sting.
