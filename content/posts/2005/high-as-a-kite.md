<p>Headed home, have a three hour drive to Portland, followed by a 3.5 hour flight to Minneapolis and then a 3 hour flight home to Pensacola.  The last flight will be the worse of it, it's a nice tiny 2x2 jet intended to be used for short hops from feeder airports to hubs.  The plane would be fine on an hour long flight but 3 hours in this cramped plane is extreme suckage.</p>

<p>Though I hate long drives, the drive to Portland shouldn't be too bad.  The interstate follows a large river and is in a valley with moutains on either side.  Check out <a href="http://thegrebs.com/~michael/pictures/kirby/kirby.html">here</a> for some shots taken on the way out.</p>

<p>Other then the extreme sprawl, Minneapolis looked quite nice from the air on the way out here.  If the battery in my D70 holds out, I'll try to get some shots on the way down.  Trees abound, a very green and attractive city from the sky indeed.</p>
