<pre>&lt;luca&gt; Bingo player Glenna Bush, who smokes, isn't sure she'll continue to play her favourite game.
&lt;luca&gt; 'I think it's terrible,' she said. 'I'm going on 80. This is the only pleasure I get now.'
&lt;luca&gt; that does not sound like a meaningful life
&lt;luca&gt; get on irc, bish</pre>
