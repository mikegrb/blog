Currently in a waiting room and CNN is on.  There was just a commercial for a Sharp deep freezer sized copier/scanner/printer/sink.  The business person googled for a restaurant to take a client to on the built in touch screen then presses a button to print a full-color map to the restaurant.  What business person would go to the copy building (a room is not big enough) to google a restaurant?

Sorry check back later for pics, Steve Jobs says I don't need copy & paste as I'm sending this from the wordpress app on my iPhone.

<strong>Update:</strong>

One note of clearification, as crazy as the feature set on these machines is, I still wouldn't mind having one to use whenever I wanted, imagine what you could do with it!  The commercial I saw is available in flash form at
