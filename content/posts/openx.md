From Gizmodo:
<blockquote>Many pints of blood have been lost by frustrated consumers as they try to claw through the mocking, thick plastic encasing their newest gadget/gardening/ bludgeoning tool. The OpenX is a great solution to an infuriating problem when normally even the sharpest of scissors force you to expel far too much effort to get to something you just purchased. Plus, with ad copy like "Just push and slide to get inside," can you honestly afford not to purchase one? For just about $10, it's not a bad deal at all.</blockquote>

I'll take three.  Buy it from their <a href="http://www.myopenx.com/order.htm">Catalog Page</a>
